<center><h1> HW: RMS value of a triangular signal </h1></center>

**Description**

Given is a triangular wave form as shown in Figure. Your job is to find out the ratio between the RMS value of any triangular wave form and its amplitude or U_RMS/U. The only thing you have to assume is that the signal is proportional to time as in ```U(t) = a*t``` where a is a constant. Then you have to calculate the RMS value using: ![figureRMS](https://localhost:1313/hw/HW_other/RMS.png)  
And divide by the Amplitude (which you also have to calculate).  
_Hint: When you calculate the integral be smart about it, there is a lot of  symmetry in the signal, use that to your advantage._


You need to show **ALL** your steps and write them in LaTex functionality (copy over the equation given above and tweak it to your needs).
