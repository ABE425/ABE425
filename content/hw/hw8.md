<center><h1> HW: Wien bridge derivation </h1></center>

**Description**

Given is the Wien bridge that is used to measure the capacitance, and series resistance of a capacitor as shown in Figure. In addition, the frequency of the input signal can be determined. Here are the equations given that the bridge is in balance:
