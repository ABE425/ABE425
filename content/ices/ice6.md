## In-Class Exercise: High Pass Filter.
```
NAME:

DATE: February 7, 2018
```
Figure 1 shows the schematic of a high-pass filter. As you can see the resistor and capacitor are reversed compared to the low pass filter.

1. Derive the transfer function of this circuit G(jω) using the voltage divider rule and the impedance of a capacitor.

2. Fill out this table:

|G(jω)    | G(jω)|db   | ø(Phase)|
|---------|------------|---------|
|ωτ << 1| | |
|ωτ >> 1| | |

3. Draw the Bode plot of this transfer function on the back of this page.

**Solution:**
