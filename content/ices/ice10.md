<h1 align="center">In-Class Exercise: Derive Taylor’s rule. </h1>


**Description**

This is In-Class Exercise 10. Read the instruction and answer the questions below. This assignment is to be submitted it in class.


**Task**

In the chapter Mathematics Recapitulation, we derive Taylor’s rule. At some point in the derivation, we make a rather large leap, it is your job to fill in how the top equation became the bottom equation.

Since f(a) and its derivatives are constant values, we can integrate this equation with respect to x leading to:

![Eqn2](https://localhost:1313/ABE425/ABE425/blob/ICES/content/ices/photo/ice10eqn2.png)

Show that this is indeed correct, you can write it out in your handout, rip out the page and hand it in.
