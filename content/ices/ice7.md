## In-Class Exercise: The tank is 3/4 full.

In 2002 there was caller in the radioshow CarTalk, who drove an 18 wheeler with saddle tanks, these are cylindrical tanks with the axis mounted horizontally. Since his fuel gage was broken, he wanted to mark a stick that he would insert vertically into the tank. Marking the half full position on the stick is trivial, but he asked where to mark the 3/4 full position on the stick (which of course also gives the 1/4 full location) due to symmetry. We can reduce the problem to a single quadrant of a circle with a radius of 1 as shown in Figure 1. The total area of this circle would be π, and therefore the area of the quadrant is π/4. To mark the quarter full point, we need to find the value of y = z where the area above the curve is equal to half the area of the quadrant which is π/8.

Before we find out what z is let’s calculate the area of the quadrant itself where y ranges from [0,1].

**Solution:**
