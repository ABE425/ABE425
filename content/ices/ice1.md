## In-Class Exercise: Circuit Analysis.

The DC circuit shown in Figure 1 has both series and parallel resistors, your job is to find thecurrents i, i1, i2 using Ohm’s Law, Kirchoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), Kirchoff’s Current Law (KCL).

Ohm’s Law: The voltage DROP (hence the ∆) ∆U across a resistor is equal to the current i flowing

through it in Ampere, times the resistor value R in Ohm.\\
∆U = iR (1)

KCL: In a node, the algebraic sum of the currents is equal to zero, in other words, what comes in must come out. In our circuit node that means:\\
i = i1 + i2  (2)

KVL: In a loop, the algebraic sum of the voltage is equal to zero. The first thing to do is put + and - signs on the resistors, the current always flows from a higher voltage to a lower voltage, in our case all currents run towards ground level (bottom) 1. In our circuit you can recognize three loops, put arrows in the circuit to indicate them.

Resistors in series: When two resistors R1, R2 are placed in series, you can replace them with a single resistor with the value being the sum of R1, R2:
\\
R_series = R1 + R2 (3)
\\

Resistors in parallel: When two resistors R1, R2 are placed in parallel, you can replace them with a single resistor with the ”product over sum” value of R1, R2: \\
R_parallel = \frac{R1R2}{R1 + R2} (4)

### Solution:
