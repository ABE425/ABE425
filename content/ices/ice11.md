## In-Class Exercise: Derive Taylor’s rule:
STUDENT NAME:
DATE: December 28, 2018

In the chapter Mathematics Recapitulation, we derive Taylor’s rule. At some point in the derivation, we make a rather large leap, it is your job to fill in how the top equation became the bottom equation.

$$ f({a}+h)\approx f({a}) + \int_{a}^{a+h}[f'({a}+(x-{a})f''(a)] dx $$

Since f(a) and its derivatives are constant values, we can integrate this equation with respect to x leading to:

Show that this is indeed correct, you can write it out in your handout, rip out the page and hand it in.

**Solution:**
