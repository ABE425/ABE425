<h1> In-Class Exercise: High Pass Filter.</h1>

**Description**

This is In-Class Exercise 5. Read the instruction and answer the questions below. This assignment is to be submitted it in class.


**Task**

Figure 1 shows the schematic of a high-pass filter. As you can see the resistor and capacitor are reversed compared to the low pass filter.

![Figure1](https://github.com/ABE425/ABE425/blob/ICES/content/ices/photo/ice5figure1.png)

1. Derive the transfer function of this circuit G(jω) using the voltage divider rule and the impedance of a capacitor.

2. Fill out this table:

|         |G(jω)    | G(jω)|db | ø(Phase)|
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
|ωτ << 1| | | |
|ωτ = 1| | | |
|ωτ >> 1| | | |

3. Draw the Bode plot of this transfer function on the back of this page.
