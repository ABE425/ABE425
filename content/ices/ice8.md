<h1> In-Class Exercise: Determine the length of Koch’s snowflake.</h1>


**Description**

This is In-Class Exercise 8. Read the instruction and answer the questions below. This assignment is to be submitted it in class.


**Task**

Figure 1 shows the first four iterations of Koch’s snowflake. Your job is to determine whether the total length of the curve is finite or infinite. Starting at iteration 0 with an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1, calculate the total length of the curve for each iteration. Hint: The total length is always three times the length of each side, so just calculate the length of each side for each iteration and multiply the result by 3.

**Solution:**
