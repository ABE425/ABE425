<h1 align="center"> In-Class Exercise: Hay bridge.</h1>

**Description**

This is In-Class Exercise 4. Read the instruction and answer the questions below. This assignment is to be submitted it in class.


**Task**

Figure 1 shows the Hay bridge, where the **device under test** is the inductor (coil) with parameters Lx and Rx. This is a non-ideal coil where we take the resistance of the coil into consideration. The input signal is a sine wave with a frequency of Ï‰ rad/s.

Zx =                                           (1)
Z1 =                                           (2)
Z2 =                                           (3)
Z3 =                                           (4)
Your job is to write out the bridge equilibrium and find expressions for Lx and Rx.

**Questions:**

1) Is the measurement dependent or independent of the frequency of the input signal?

2) Are the measurement of Lx and Rx independent? What does this mean for the person who is
doing the measurement?
