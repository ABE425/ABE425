## In-Class Exercise: English Unit System Derived.

STUDENT NAME:  
DATE：January 13, 2018


Given is the modern (not yet completed) metric system where the Ampere (which was not realizable
anyway) is replaced by the standard for Volt (via the Josephson junction) and the Ohm (via the
Hall effect, Von Klitzing constant). Also the kg is here a derived unit through the Watt Balance
which equalizes the Mechanical and Electrical power.
Your assignment is to do the the same thing, but you can only use English units. Draw it all
in there with pencil, rip out the page and hand it in (don’t forget your name).
