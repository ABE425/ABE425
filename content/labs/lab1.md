## Circuit Analysis

Lab date: 01/19/2018

Due date: 01/26/2018


#### Lab Objectives:  
1. To understand how to read resistor values using the color coding system
2. To measure the true value of resistors using a handheld Digital Multimeter (DMM)
3. To build a simple resistor circuit using a standard breadboard
4. To measure voltage drops across resistors using the DMM
5. To measure current ﬂowing in a branch
6. To understand why measuring voltages is safe, since the internal resistance of the meter in that setting is near inﬁnite (at least 107Ω or 10 MegaOhm )
7. To understand why measuring current can be dangerous, since the internal resistance of the meter in that setting is zero, and shortcuts can be easily made.
8. To understand and verify the three basic circuit laws being i) Ohm’s Law, ii) Kirchoﬀ’s Voltage Law (KVL) and iii) Kirchoﬀ’s Current Law (KCL)
