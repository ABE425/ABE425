## Temperature Measurement Using LabVIEW

Lab date: 03/09/2018

Due date: 03/16/2018


#### Lab Objectives:  
This lab is designed to give students experience in LabVIEW, with an application of temperature measurement.
The objectives of this lab are:
1. To understand the development environment of LabVIEW using a front panel and a block diagram.
2. Gain experience in building an accurate temperature sensing circuit containing a commercially available thermistor (semiconductor temperature sensor) using its data sheet.
3. Understand the importance of standards and calibration, here using the triple point of water.
