## Frequency Doman Analysis of First Order Systems (Passive Filters)

Lab date: 02/02/2018

Due date: 02/09/2018


#### Lab Objectives:  
The objective of this lab is to understand the functioning of two RC networks being a low pass and a high pass ﬁlter in the Frequency domain.

#### Introduction:  
Filters are used to suppress undesired frequencies in signals (such as noise) and to avoid a phenomenon called aliasing. RC passive ﬁlters are simple in design, but have limited performance. In this lab you will analyze the frequency domain behavior of these ﬁlters using an oscilloscope.
