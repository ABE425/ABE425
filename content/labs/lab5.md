## OpAmps and Passive Filters

Lab date: 02/16/2018

#### Lab Objectives:  
To understand the principle of Operational Ampliﬁers and their use in Ampliﬁcation/Attenuation and in active low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters.

#### Introduction:  
Operational Ampliﬁers are low cost, simple to use and serve myriad of applications. For instance they can be used as buﬀers (to prevent loading errors), as ampliﬁers to magnify a signal’s amplitude, as well as integrator/diﬀerentiator and adders/subtractors. The latter functionality is where the Operational Ampliﬁer gets its name. OpAmps are near ideal ampliﬁers with a near inﬁnite input impedance (up to 10 MΩ), and a near zero output impedance (typically 1 Ω). The theoretical open loop ampliﬁcation factor is very high, in the order of 106. To obtain reasonable ampliﬁcation values, external resistors are used. The resulting ampliﬁcation is termed the closed loop ampliﬁcation factor. When components such as capacitors are added, ﬁlters are obtained. The combination of an ampliﬁcation and ﬁlter function is called an active ﬁlter. The pin layout of the 741 OpAmp is shown in Figure 1 and the complete datasheet can be found here.
